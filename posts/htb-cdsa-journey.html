                    <h3>Why I went for CDSA</h3>
                    <p>I (re)found Hack The Box Academy at a good moment in my career and worked through the Windows Attack and Defense module and later the SOC Analyst job role path. Those modules added real depth around Windows security, incident handling, and how to structure investigations. I was hooked, and it felt like the right time to aim for the <b>Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA)</b>.</p>

                    <p>Huge thanks to Solita for supporting my learning along the way. That support made it possible to keep putting time into the coursework and practice.</p>

                    <h3>Preparation: what actually helped</h3>
                    <p>My prep was less about "new tricks" and more about building repeatable habits. The biggest gains came from practicing the same workflows until they felt natural.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Finishing the SOC Analyst path</b> and revisiting the parts that felt weakest, especially incident handling.</li>
                        <li><b>Hands-on malware analysis in VMs</b> to get comfortable with obfuscation, scripting payloads, and quick triage.</li>
                        <li><b>Detection rule practice</b> with YARA and SIGMA, plus a lot of log review in SIEMs.</li>
                        <li><b>Tool familiarity</b> with x64dbg, Chainsaw, Splunk, Velociraptor, and the Windows event ecosystem.</li>
                        <li><b>Documentation habits</b> in Obsidian so I could quickly reuse notes, queries, and templates.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Exam week (Attempt 1)</h3>
                    <p>I originally planned a single weekend, but after reading advice from others, I switched to a full week of vacation days. That week had to wait because I started a new role at Splynter, so the exam was postponed for a couple of months.</p>

                    <p>When the week finally came, I leaned heavily on my Obsidian notes and the experience I had built up on the job. I cannot talk about the exam content due to the NDA, but the overall flow is very practical and focused on investigative discipline rather than trivia.</p>

                    <h4>How I approached it</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Start the report immediately.</b> I used <a href="https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SysReptor</a> to avoid losing time to formatting later.</li>
                        <li><b>Build a timeline early.</b> It keeps you grounded when the data gets noisy.</li>
                        <li><b>Pivot across sources.</b> I cross-checked findings between different log sources before committing to conclusions.</li>
                        <li><b>Take breaks.</b> Short walks helped me reset and see patterns again.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Result and reflection</h3>
                    <p>I passed and became a certified HTB Defensive Security Analyst. It was a year-long effort with a few pauses along the way, and it reminded me how much I enjoy the investigative side of security.</p>

                    <p>Thanks again to Solita for supporting my growth, and to Splynter for being a great environment to sharpen defensive skills.</p>

                    <h3>Advice for future candidates (high-level)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Practice the workflow, not just the theory.</b> The modules matter, but the exam rewards real investigative rhythm.</li>
                        <li><b>Get comfortable with logs.</b> Knowing where to look and how to pivot is the real time saver.</li>
                        <li><b>Document as you go.</b> A consistent template saves hours during the exam week.</li>
                        <li><b>Respect the NDA.</b> Focus on the experience and the learning, not the scenario details.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preparation is about repetition and consistency, not cramming</li>
                        <li>Incident handling feels natural when your documentation is solid</li>
                        <li>Hands-on malware practice in VMs pays off under time pressure</li>
                        <li>Obsidian-style notes make it easy to move fast without skipping steps</li>
                        <li>Taking breaks is a skill, not a luxury</li>
                    </ul>
