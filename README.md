# Introduction


# Configuration

## Running locally


- Option 1: double-click `index.html` and open it in any modern browser; this works because all assets live under `css/`, `js/`, and `assets/` in the repository.
- Option 2: if you prefer a local web server (mirrors how GitHub Pages serves files), run `python3 -m http.server 8000` from the project root and visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.
- When adding new images or fonts later, place them under `assets/` (or a new folder) and keep the paths relative (e.g., `assets/image.png`) so both local preview options continue to work.
